# Joining Bird Bands

When information could unintentionally be duplicated, data is often stored in separate tables with reference to an `id`. In the case of the dataset you will explore, most of the unique identifiers are labeled with the word `code`.

In this activity, you will be using joins to learn more about North American bird banding. The example contains data reduced from its original source, so if you would like to explore the data further, click the link in the Reference section.

## Instructions

* Create a new database named `bird_banding_DB`, and create eight new tables with pgAdmin named `bird_bands`, `age`, `band_type`, `bird_status`, `country_state`, `event_type`, `extra_info` and `sex`.

* Copy the code from `schema.sql` to create the tables, and then import the corresponding data from the CSV files with the same names. **Note:** Remember to refresh the database. Newly created tables will not immediately appear.

* Perform joins that will generate the following outputs:
